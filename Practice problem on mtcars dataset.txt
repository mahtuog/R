Description about the "mtcars" data set can be found in the below link 

https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html
 

Create a new data frame from the mtcars built in data set in RStudio. The new data frame must have the following colunms 



Col 1 : 
Cubic capacity in cubic centemeters and this must be a whole number ( with floor and ceiling corrected based on > or < 0.5 respectively Hint : Use the round() function) the existing data frame contains this data in cubic inches (engine diplacement column)

1 cubic inch = 16.387 cubic centimeteres 

  
Col 2 : Power is to Weight Ratio, weight of the car is provided in units per 1000 LBS, you would need to convert it to LB's first and then calculate the power/weight ratio. In case if this is in too low a decimal number, then you will have to represent it appropriately by convering it to a whole number which is readable. 

 
Col 3 : Milage 


The final output must be saved in a file in a CSV file where the data frame is sorted based on the cc of the engine. The final output must contain the rows of only those car models where is engine capacity is greater than 2500 and sorted by the cubic capacity of the engine. Car name as the row name must be present in the final output file.  
   

The code should be well organized into user defined functions wherever applicable.
